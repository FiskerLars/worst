 == WORST -- Webpage ORganisation STyles

A small script to generate repetetive (by structure) pages of
non-repetetive Images with texts from a description file.

== Build

$ ghc worst.hs

== Install 

(No experiences, try and tell me)

== Usage

Create a template html file including the Strings
IMAGE
PREV
NEXT
ALTTEXT
PROJTEXT

and a description file, consisting of only semicolon-separated lines like the following

rel-image-path ; previous page ; next page ; alttext for image ; path to file with longer description

you may use <- and -> instead of previous or next page links. They will be filled up by the name of the filename of the file generated by the previous or next line.

Target filenames are made up out of the template file name, where the extension and any occurrence after "template" is dropped and a two-digit number (think "%02d") and ".html" are appended.

$ worst template.html description.txt
